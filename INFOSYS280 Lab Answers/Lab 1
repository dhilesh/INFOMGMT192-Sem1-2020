/* Expressions using arithmetic operators */

// 2) Write an expression that adds the following five numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

// Sum of 5 numbers
console.log(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5);

// 3) Write an expression that calculates the area of a triangle with base and height defined as variables with values of your choice.

let base = 10;
let height = 20;

// Area of a triangle: (base x height) / 2
let areaTriangle = (base * height) / 2
console.log(areaTriangle);

// 4) Write an expression that calculates the volume of a sphere with radio defined as a variable with the value of your choice. Use 3.14 as the value for pi.

let radio = 10;
const pi = 3.14;

// Volume of a sphere (4/3) * 3.14 * (r^3)
let volumeSphere = (4/3) * pi * (radio ** 3);
console.log(volumeSphere);

/* Expressions using string operators */

// 5) Write a single expression that displays the following message: The sum of 5 and 3 is: 8. You must specify 8 as the result of the arithmetic operation 5 + 3.

console.log("The sum of 5 and 3 is: " + (5 + 3));

// 6) Write a single expression that displays the following message: "My age is 33 years old." You must specify your age as a variable.

let myAge = 33;
console.log("My age is " + myAge + " years old.");

// 7) Write a single expression that displays the following message: "In JavaScript, we use the backslash (\) to escape special characters.""

console.log("In JavaScript, we use the backlash (\\) to escape special characters.");

// 8) Write a single expression that displays the following message: Einstein once said: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.".

console.log('Einstein once said: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving."');

/* Expressions using comparison operators */

// 9) Write an expression that takes two numbers defined as variables with values of your choice and evaluates whether the first number is greater or equal than the second. You must output a boolean value as a result of the comparison.

let var_9_1 = 5;
let var_9_2 = 10;
console.log(var_9_1 >= var_9_2);

/* Expressions using logical operators */

// 10) The XOR operation is commonly used internally by computers to perform arithmetic operations. When using boolean values, the XOR operation evaluates to false only when both values are equal (e.g., both values are true or false) and true otherwise. Write an expression that performs the XOR operation for two boolean values defined as variables with values of your choice. Your expression must use the AND (&&) and OR (||) operators. You may test your expression by changing the value of your variables.

let var_10_1 = true;
let var_10_2 = false;
// With the values true and false, the result should be true
console.log( (var_10_1 && !var_10_2 ) || ( !var_10_1 && var_10_2 ));

// 11) Write an expression that evaluates whether two numeric values defined with values of your choice satisfies the following condition: the first number is greater than the second and the second number is greater than 0.

let var_11_1 = 5;
let var_11_2 = 15;
console.log( (var_10_1 > var_10_2) && (var_10_2 >= 0) );

// 12) Write an expression that evaluates whether two numeric values defined with values of your choice satisfies the following condition: both numbers are equal or the second number is less than 10.

let var_12_1 = 5;
let var_12_2 = 15;
console.log( (var_12_1 == var_12_2) || (var_12_1 < 10) );

// 13) Use the typeof operator to evaluate whether a variable is a number. You must output a boolean value as a result of the evaluation

let var_13 = 5;
console.log(typeof var_13 == "number");

// 14) Write an expression that evaluates whether the sum of two numbers defined as variables with values of your choice is greater than their product.

let var_14_1 = 1;
let var_14_2 = 3;

console.log( (var_14_1 + var_14_2) > (var_14_1 * var_14_2) );

// 15) Write an expression that tells whether the volume of a cone with base B and height H is greater than the volume of a cylinder with radius of the same base and height of the cone. You must display the message: The volume of the cone (<volume of the cone>) is greater than the volume of the cylinder (<volume of the cylinder>): <result>. <result> can take the value of true or false depending on your comparison. You must define the values required as variables.

let base_15 = 10;
let height_15 = 5;
// Volume of a cone: π * r^2 * (h/3)
let coneVol = pi * (base_15 ** 2) * (height_15 / 3);

// Volume of a π * r^2 * h
let cylinderVol = pi * (base_15 ** 2) * height_15;

let comparison = coneVol > cylinderVol;

console.log("The volume of the cone (" + coneVol + ") is greater than the volume of the cylinder (" + cylinderVol + "): " + comparison);
