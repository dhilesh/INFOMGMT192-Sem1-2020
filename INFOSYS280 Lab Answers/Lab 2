/* 1. Write a program that asks the user the height and then the weight of a person. Then, your program should assess the body mass index (BMI) category according to the following rules:

Underweight: BMI of 18.5 or less
Normal weight: BMI between 18.6 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater

Your program must calculate the BMI using the formula: weight / (height^2).


To simplify your program:
Assume the user enters number values. Thus no further validation is necessary.
Assume the user enters quantities that follow the metric system, i.e., kilograms and meters.
